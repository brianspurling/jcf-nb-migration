# JCF NationBuilder Migration

This script will take a CSV extract from JCF's legacy CRM system and
transform & clean it ready for loading into NationBuilder

To use, download or clone the repository, place a CSV containing the legacy
system's data in the same directory, set the values in config.py accordingly,
and run python `main.py` from the command line
